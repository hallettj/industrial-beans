# Industrial Beans

Witness towering factories bellowing smoke, thunderous machinery churning day
and night to fill cavernous silos with goods. The industrial revolution has
come to Minecraft!

This is a collection of data packs that extend vanilla Minecraft with in-world
crafting recipes, and other tweaks to enable automation.

## How to use

The data packs can be used in a multi-player or single-player world in
Minecraft 1.13 or later.
Download the data packs from the [releases][] page, and save them in the
`datapacks/` folder of your Minecraft world / save.
For more detailed instructions see
[Tutorials/Installing a data pack][installing].

## The data packs

One data pack has been implemented so far:

### Automatically Craft dried kelp blocks and hay bales

[[Download v1.0.0]](https://github.com/hallettj/industrial-beans/releases/download/v1.0.0/craft_kelp_blocks.zip)

Drop nine pieces of dried kelp and dispense a string to produce a dried kelp
block. The kelp may be dropped by a dropper, a water stream, or whatever
mechanism you can imagine. This also works to make hay bales from wheat!

A fully-automated machine requires precision engineering, and careful planning.
You must use *exactly* nine pieces of kelp - no more, no fewer. The pieces must
be grouped in a single stack.

Convenience comes at a cost: automatic production is not as resource-efficient
as hand-crafting. The string that is dispensed will be consumed in addition to
the nine pieces of dried kelp.

Tip: try using a binary counter to trigger a dispenser once for every nine
times a dropper is triggered.

## Planned data packs

More packs may be implemented in the future.
Here are some ideas that are in the works:

- drop an anvil on bones to produce bone meal
- saplings and seeds become planted when a mob walks on them
- (alternatively) push an iron bar down onto a sapling with a piston to plant the sapling

Note that these are possible ideas - not all of them will be implemented.
